# SANCHEZ RECORDS
React web application with tailwind css that displays information retrieved from `https://rickandmortyapi.com` The web application isn't responsive and work for screen sizes bigger than ipad because i am lazy and you can do nothing about it. With the exception of SVGR which turns svg into React components, all the React components are built from scratch with tailwind css.
